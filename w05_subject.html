        <h2>The making of tetris</h2>
        <p>On the summer of 1984, Alexey Pajitnov thought of a new game idea, a puzzle game on the computers to fit tetrominos together on a board. <i>A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally</i></p>
        <h4>He named this game: Tetris</h4>
        <p>After writing this game for the Electronika 60 computer architecture, Pajitnov's colleagues wrote a version for IBM computers: allowing for graphics and sound</p>
        <h6>After the versions were released in the college, it became a sensation over night.</h6>
        <p>Then, Robert Stein (a software salesman) got the liscening rights to Tetris, so he sub-licensed it to Microsoft and Spectrum HoloByte</p>
        <p>Next Henk Rogers and Russian government fought against each other to get rights to the game, and eventually, Henk Rogers got the rights to give to Nintendo.</p>
        <p>Nintendo took these rights and put Tetris onto the Nintendo Entertainment System, the <b>NES</b></p>
        <h2>Tetris takes off!! NES tetris then and now.</h2>
        <p>Immedietly, Tetris took the world by storm. Because it was sold in a home console, people bought it even more because of the convenience of playing at home instead of at an arcade.</p>
        <p>And Tetris didn't just get used and then put in a closet to grow dust, it was <em>here to stay</em>. Currently, millions of copies have been sold world wide.</p>

        <p>Currently NES tetris is stilled being played. The biggest news, recently, was a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/arts/tetris-beat-blue-scuti.html">13-year-old boy who beat NES tetris</a>, the first to ever do it.</p>
        <h2>Modern Tetris: Tetris for the virtual generation</h2>

        <p>Here is an image from a multiplayer game in tetr.io</p>
        <p>If you look at the bottom of the screens, there are gray blocks. These blocks are called <em>garbage</em>. Garbage is sent to the bottom of the other persons field when the player scores lines.</p>
