        <h2>The making of tetris</h2>
        <p>On the summer of 1984, Alexey Pajitnov thought of a new game idea, a puzzle game on the computers to fit tetrominos together on a board. <i>A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally</i></p>
        <h4>He named this game: Tetris</h4>
        <p>After writing this game for the Electronika 60 computer architecture, Pajitnov's colleagues wrote a version for IBM computers: allowing for graphics and sound</p>
        <h6>After the versions were released in the college, it became a sensation over night.</h6>
        <p>Then, Robert Stein (a software salesman) got the liscening rights to Tetris, so he sub-licensed it to Microsoft and Spectrum HoloByte</p>
        <p>Next Henk Rogers and Russian government fought against each other to get rights to the game, and eventually, Henk Rogers got the rights to give to Nintendo.</p>
        <p>Nintendo took these rights and put Tetris onto the Nintendo Entertainment System, the <b>NES</b>.</p>
